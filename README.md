Title of the Project 
PreAir : Deep Learning Based on Prediction System and Image Classification for Detecting Air Quality Index.

Executive Summary/Abstract
The decrease air quality in the biosphere layer is a serious impact due to the effects of globalization and urbanization. Air pollution levels in many cities exceed legal threshold which can increase humans affected from respiratory disorders such as asthma, lung disease and increased mortality. In some big cities in Indonesia, people not realize of the pollution level they face in their daily life and it can be ‘silent killer’ to people. This is necessary to reduce the risk of poor air quality conditions. The quality of air can be measured by using a parameter named Air Quality Index(AQI). The key pollutants to calculate AQI are particulate matter Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO). Our projects deliberates the implementation of prediction and analyzing system for air quality monitoring using smartphone camera device and combine it with environmental condition like temperature and humidity. The obtained information and data can be updated in cloud platform. With the collected time series samples, the prediction analysis was done with neural network Multi-Layer. This can helps user monitor AQI-Level in their environment through a smartphone that always updates air condition based on database in cloud every few hours. 

Background of The Project
Our team chose this project because we saw the increasingly apprehensive natural conditions, especially the air pollution in most of the big cities in Indonesia that's experiencing rapid urbanization. Poor Air Quality Index (AQI) can cause health problems such as respiratory diseases, the risk of developing cancer and other serious ailments. It also contributes tremendous economic loss, especially since financial resources are required for giving medical assistance to the affected people. By utilizing Machine Learning technology, our team utilizes images taken by users from smartphones for testing and training. So that users get the AQI  Level output on their smartphone.
